"""Run the pi `wservice' VM (templeArtemisEphesus/pi-vm/basic/wservice.nix) and
stream its `pi --mode json' JSON event output to stdout or to a file.

The prompt fed to `pi' is read from stdin: pipe it in, or type it in a
terminal and finish with Ctrl-D.

Host directories are shared with the VM through qemu 9p shares:

  --workdir/-w        mounted read-write, used as pi's working directory
                      (default: a fresh /tmp/run-wservice-vm-<timestamp>-XXXX
                      directory whose name records when the program ran)
  --read-write/-rw    mounted read-write (repeatable)
  --read-only/-ro     mounted read-only (repeatable)

  --disk-size/-d      disk space allocated to the virtual machine, i.e. the
                      size of the VM's root disk image (e.g. 8G, 2048M, or a
                      plain byte count). Optional: falls back to the
                      PI_VM_DISK_SIZE environment variable and then to 10G.

  --ram/-r            RAM allocated to the virtual machine (e.g. 2G, 2048M,
                      or a plain byte count). Optional: falls back to the
                      PI_VM_RAM environment variable and then to the build-
                      time default (2048M, see bare.nix).

The 9p shares and the mount manifest (fw_cfg file `opt/pi/mounts') that the
guest service reads to mount them are set up here; see wservice.nix.

The VM's root disk is sized at run time with the obligatory option
--disk-size/-d: this program creates the disk image itself (an ext4-
formatted sparse raw file of the requested size, labeled `nixos' exactly
like the image the VM's runner script would create) and passes it to the VM
script through the NIX_DISK_IMAGE environment variable; the script only
creates its own (build-time-sized) image when that file does not exist
already, so the requested size takes effect. The image is ephemeral: it
lives in this program's temporary directory and is deleted when the VM is
done.

The JSON event stream crosses the VM boundary through a virtio-serial port
that qemu bridges to a host unix socket (-chardev socket,server=on,wait=off);
this program connects to that socket as soon as qemu starts listening and
forwards everything it receives to stdout or to --output/-o. qemu discards
chardev writes made while no client is attached, so the connect must happen
promptly (the guest's pi-json service only starts writing after boot, so
connecting within a second or two is safe).

The VM's serial console (kernel messages, getty) is non-interactive here: it
cannot take over the terminal the program is run from (the subprocess's stdin
is /dev/null, so there is no way to type into the VM's console shell); all of
its output is sent to this program's stderr. When the program finishes, it
also reports on stderr the host locations of all the paths that were passed
to it (via --workdir/-w, --read-write/-rw and --read-only/-ro) and shared
with the VM.

The host's /run/secrets/OPENROUTER_API_KEY, if it exists and is readable, is
passed to the VM through the fw_cfg file `opt/pi/api-key' (see wservice.nix).
