# Creates a new VM from ../bare.nix (`import` + `extendModules`), adding exactly
# one single new service: `pi-json` (see the `wserviceModule` below).
#
# The service reads the contents of a string located in the vm's
# /sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg tree and calls `pi --mode json` with it, streaming
# pi's JSON event output to a unix socket the host can read.
#
# The fw_cfg string's contents are left undetermined here; they become
# available due to options passed to the qemu command line later, e.g.
#   -fw_cfg name=opt/pi/json-prompt,string=<contents>
#
# Because AF_UNIX sockets are kernel-local, the output stream crosses the VM
# boundary through a virtio-serial port, which the host's later qemu command
# line bridges to a host unix socket:
#   -chardev socket,id=pi-json,path=<host-socket>,server=on,wait=off
#   -device virtio-serial-pci
#   -device virtserialport,chardev=pi-json,name=pi-json
# The host then reads the stream by connecting a client to <host-socket>, e.g.
#   socat - UNIX-CONNECT:<host-socket>
# Note: qemu discards chardev writes made while no client is attached, so the
# host must connect promptly.
#
# The shared ~/.pi/agent/auth.json resolves the openrouter key through
# `! cat /run/secrets/OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; the service provisions it (mode
# 0600) from the optional fw_cfg file `opt/pi/api-key` if the host passed
# e.g. -fw_cfg name=opt/pi/api-key,file=<path-to-key-file>
#
# Host directories can be shared with the VM over 9p (the packaged runner
# `run-pi-vm' in ../default.nix, from ./runWserviceVm.py, wires all of
# this up): the host's qemu command line
# passes a tab-separated mounts manifest as the fw_cfg file opt/pi/mounts,
#
#   -fw_cfg name=opt/pi/mounts,file=<manifest>
#
# with one line per share: <workdir|rw|ro> <TAB> <mount tag> <TAB> <guest
# mountpoint>, and exposes each tag as a 9p share, e.g.
#
#   -fsdev local,id=pi-fs0,path=<host path>,security_model=none,readonly=off
#   -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=pi-fs0,mount_tag=pi-workdir
#
# The service below mounts each share (read-only ones with ro) and runs pi
# from the workdir share's guest mountpoint. When the pi-json service ends
# (pi finished, or it failed to start), the vm powers itself off, so a host
# runner reading the stream socket sees the stream end cleanly.
