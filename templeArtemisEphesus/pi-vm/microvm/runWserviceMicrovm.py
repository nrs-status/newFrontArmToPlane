"""Run the pi `wservice' microvm (templeArtemisEphesus/pi-vm/microvm/
wservice-microvm.nix, built with the microvm.nix modules) and stream its
`pi --mode json' JSON event output to stdout or to a file.

This is the micro-VM twin of run-wservice-vm
(../basic/runWserviceVm.py): it has the exact same capabilities and behavior, with
the difference that the VM is a microvm.nix microvm (the qemu hypervisor
boots the kernel directly with the QEMU `microvm' machine type).

The prompt fed to `pi' is read from stdin: pipe it in, or type it in a
terminal and finish with Ctrl-D.

Host directories are shared with the VM through qemu 9p shares:

  --workdir/-w        mounted read-write, used as pi's working directory
                      (default: a fresh /tmp/run-pi-microvm-<timestamp>-XXXX
                      directory whose name records when the program ran)
  --read-write/-rw    mounted read-write (repeatable)
  --read-only/-ro     mounted read-only (repeatable)

  --disk-size/-d      disk space allocated to the virtual machine, i.e. the
                      size of the disk image attached to the VM as a
                      virtio-blk drive (e.g. 8G, 2048M, or a plain byte
                      count). Optional: falls back to the PI_VM_DISK_SIZE
                      environment variable and then to 10G.

  --ram/-r            RAM allocated to the virtual machine (e.g. 2G, 2048M,
                      or a plain byte count). Optional: falls back to the
                      PI_VM_RAM environment variable and then to the build-
                      time default (1536M, see wservice-microvm.nix).

The 9p shares and the mount manifest (fw_cfg file `opt/pi/mounts') that the
guest service reads to mount them are set up here; see wservice-microvm.nix.

The disk space allocated to the VM is set at run time with the obligatory
option --disk-size/-d: this program creates an ext4-formatted sparse raw disk
image of the requested size in its temporary directory (labeled
`pi-microvm-data') and attaches it to the qemu command line (passed through
QEMU_OPTS, like every other dynamic option) as a virtio-blk drive; the guest
sees it as /dev/vda. The image is ephemeral: it lives in this program's
temporary directory and is deleted when the VM is done.

The JSON event stream crosses the VM boundary through a virtio-serial port
that qemu bridges to a host unix socket (-chardev socket,server=on,wait=off);
this program connects to that socket as soon as qemu starts listening and
forwards everything it receives to stdout or to --output/-o. qemu discards
chardev writes made while no client is attached, so the connect must happen
promptly (the guest's pi-json service only starts writing after boot, so
connecting within a second or two is safe).

The VM's serial console (kernel messages, getty) is non-interactive here: it
cannot take over the terminal the program is run from (the subprocess's stdin
is /dev/null, so there is no way to type into the VM's console shell); all of
its output is sent to this program's stderr. When the program finishes, it
also reports on stderr the host locations of all the paths that were passed
to it (via --workdir/-w, --read-write/-rw and --read-only/-ro) and shared
with the VM.

The host's /run/secrets/OPENROUTER_API_KEY, if it exists and is readable, is
passed to the VM through the fw_cfg file `opt/pi/api-key' (see
wservice-microvm.nix).

The microvm.nix runner (`microvm-run') has no mechanism for extra qemu
options of its own, but the configuration (wservice-microvm.nix) sets
`microvm.extraArgsScript' to a script that echoes the QEMU_OPTS environment
variable; this program passes all of its dynamic qemu options (9p shares,
virtio-serial chardev, fw_cfg entries) through that variable, word-split like
the non-microvm `run-pi-vm-vm' script does.
