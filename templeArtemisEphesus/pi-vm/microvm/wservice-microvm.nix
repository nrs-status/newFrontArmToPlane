#
# Like wservice.nix, this creates a NixOS configuration from a minimal base
# (here: the microvm.nix modules, github.com/microvm-nix/microvm.nix, instead
# of the qemu-vm.nix-based ../bare.nix) and adds exactly one single new
# service: `pi-json`, which reads the contents of a string located in the
# vm's /sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg tree and calls `pi --mode json` with it,
# streaming pi's JSON event output to a unix socket the host can read.
#
# The fw_cfg string's contents are left undetermined here; they become
# available due to options passed to the qemu command line later, e.g.
#   -fw_cfg name=opt/pi/json-prompt,string=<contents>
#
# Because AF_UNIX sockets are kernel-local, the output stream crosses the VM
# boundary through a virtio-serial port, which the host's later qemu command
# line bridges to a host unix socket:
#   -chardev socket,id=pi-json,path=<host-socket>,server=on,wait=off
#   -device virtio-serial-pci
#   -device virtserialport,chardev=pi-json,name=pi-json
# The host then reads the stream by connecting a client to <host-socket>, e.g.
#   socat - UNIX-CONNECT:<host-socket>
# Note: qemu discards chardev writes made while no client is attached, so the
# host must connect promptly.
#
# The shared ~/.pi/agent/auth.json resolves the openrouter key through
# `! cat /run/secrets/OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; the service provisions it (mode
# 0600) from the optional fw_cfg file `opt/pi/api-key` if the host passed
# e.g. -fw_cfg name=opt/pi/api-key,file=<path-to-key-file>
#
# Host directories can be shared with the VM over 9p (the packaged runner
# `run-pi-microvm' in ../default.nix, from ./runWserviceMicrovm.py, wires all
# of this up): the host's qemu command line passes a tab-separated mounts
# manifest as the fw_cfg file opt/pi/mounts,
#
#   -fw_cfg name=opt/pi/mounts,file=<manifest>
#
# with one line per share: <workdir|rw|ro> <TAB> <mount tag> <TAB> <guest
# mountpoint>, and exposes each tag as a 9p share, e.g.
#
#   -fsdev local,id=pi-fs0,path=<host path>,security_model=none,readonly=off
#   -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=pi-fs0,mount_tag=pi-workdir
#
# The service below mounts each share (read-only ones with ro) and runs pi
# from the workdir share's guest mountpoint. When the pi-json service ends
# (pi finished, or it failed to start), the vm powers itself off, so a host
# runner reading the stream socket sees the stream end cleanly.
#
# The microvm.nix differences from the qemu-vm.nix-based wservice VM:
# - the microvm.nix guest module (`microvmFlake.nixosModules.microvm') builds
#   the VM: the qemu hypervisor boots the kernel directly (`-M microvm`), so
#   there is no bootloader and no virtual display;
# - the runner script (config.microvm.declaredRunner) has no mechanism for
#   extra qemu options like the `run-pi-vm-vm' script's QEMU_OPTS variable,
#   but `microvm.extraArgsScript' provides the same thing: a script run by
#   `microvm-run' at start time whose stdout is word-split into extra qemu
#   command line options. This module sets it to echo the QEMU_OPTS
#   environment variable, so host runners can pass dynamic options exactly
#   like for the non-microvm wservice VM;
# - the host's /nix/store is shared as a static 9p share (tag `ro-store')
#   when `mountHostNixStore' is true, instead of the qemu-vm.nix
#   `virtualisation.mountHostNixStore' option;
# - /nix/store is a writable overlayfs (see the `writableStoreOverlay'
#   volume below): its read-only layers are the store disk (when
#   `mountHostNixStore' is false) or the `ro-store' 9p share (when true),
#   and its writable layer lives on the ext4 volume mounted at
#   /nix/.rw-store. 9p/virtiofs shares do not work as the overlay's upper
#   layer, so the docs resort to a volume for it (microvm.nix docs,
#   "Writable /nix/store overlay" in doc/src/shares.md).
